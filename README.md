A voice notes summarizer which gives a summary of a voice recording provided or text input provided.

The application converts a voice recording into a text file and then the text file is analysed and a summary of the text file is provided as the output. The application can directly analyse a text file or input text and provide the summary as well. This comes in handy to automatically get the main points from online meetings so that people who may have missed the meeting can just go through the summary to understand what was it all about or people can even go through summary in order to recollect what was discussed. Going through voice recording is time consuming and hence, we have come forward with this idea.
